	<h3> Where I'm From...</h3>
		<div style="margin-left: 1em;">
		<ul>
			<li> Lagos, Nigeria ðŸ‡³ðŸ‡¬ </li>
			 I was born in the seaport city of 
			Lagos, Nigeria to a very large extended
				family with members scattered all over the world - from
				London, to Nigeria, to North America. I am Igbo - one of Nigeria's largest
				tribal groups. I came to the U.S. with my mother and father in 1999. Since
				then I have lived in the following places: 
				<ol>
			<li> Roxbury, Massachusetts ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸ </li>
			<li> Braintree, Massachusetts </li> 
			<li> Wellesley, Massachusetts </li>
			</ol>
		</ul>
		</div>
	
	<h3> And Where I'm Going</h3>
		<div style="margin-left: 1em;"> Following graduation, it is my sincerest hope that my planning will culminate in taking a year off interning at a biotechnology company or NGO before applying to MITâ€™s Technology and Policy Program armed with the experience and lifelong connections that my liberal arts education will imbue in me in order to create meaningful impact in the field of public health especially in service to those at the greatest disadvantage in society.
		
		 I am also fascinated by the intersection between Biology, Computer Science, and Healthcare.
		That is one one of the reasons I'm currently taking CS 115: Computing For The Socio-Techno; to further
		understand how technology can influence medicine and healthcare for the better. I would like a career relating to healthcare policy or biotechnology. </div>
		
		<div style="margin-left: 1em;"> My top goals in life is to not only have enough money to support my family
		and those we left behind in Nigeria...but for me to also be able to support
		one of my favorite organizations:
			<ul>
				<li> <a href = "https://love146.org/">Love146</a>: " an international human rights organization working to end child
				trafficking exploitation through survivor care and prevention."
			</ul>
		</div>
	
	<h3> My Hobbies </h3>
			<div style="margin-left: 1em;">I would like a career relating to healthcare policy or biotechnology. My greatest joys in life are the ones I experience when I am alone. This includes 
		listening to my favorite musician's - from Maria Callas, to the Internet, to Azealia Banks </div> 
			<img src = " ../hw2/images/Maria-Callas.jpg" alt= "Maria Callas" height = 200> 
			<img src = " ../hw2/images/Syd.jpg" alt = "Syd tha Kid" height = 200>
			<img src = " ../hw2/images/Syd.png" alt = "Azealia Banks" height = 200>
		
			<div style="margin-left: 1em;">I would like a career relating to healthcare policy or biotechnology. I love fashion as a performance art; a medium to explore the undiscovered aspects of myself.
		I maintain a blog full with images of my favorite models, styles, and aesthetics.  One of my
		favorite model of ALL TIME is Naomi Campbell: </div>
		<p><img src = " ../hw2/images/Naomi.gif" alt = "Naomi Campbell" height = 200></p>
